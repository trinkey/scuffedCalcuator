# Scuffed Calculator
A very good calculator I promise

In the folder with calculator.py, make sure that there is a folder called calculatorIcons, and make sure that in the folder are the gif files.
(optional step) Then, install the font Cousine (unzip the zip file called Cousine) to your computer.
Now just run the python file and it should all work perfectly fine!
